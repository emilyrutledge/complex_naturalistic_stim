# complex_naturalistic_stimulus

Most neuroscience experiments utilize tightly controlled stimulus in order to provide and generate results that are easily interpretable and follow simple rules of biology. At the same time, we hoped that these results could be extrapolated and reflect the neural functions of the brain in a real-world context. But to what extent do our models actually generalize outside the laboratory? What proportion of neural or behavioral variability do our models predict in real-life context? The brain encounters many issues outside a controlled laboratory setting. Evolution has nurtured brains to function in a multidimensional world where it cannot rely on simple and easily interpreted signals, simply because the real world does not incorporate these types of stimuli that can be directly analyzed. A brain is not designed to distinctively segregate signals from noises and it does not conform to the theoretical boundaries established in the lab. Furthermore, ecological signals are intermixed between relevant and non relevant signals; therefore, the brain cannot ignore the irrelevant aspects and must adjust accordingly to these irrelevant aspects in order to coordinate behavior.  

## the necessary shift towards naturalistic stimulus

All these issues have prompted the research industry to shift towards the use of naturalistic models and stimulus. Originally, naturalistic models were introduced to validate results derived from pre-existing tightly controlled experiments. However, they are now beginning to dominate tightly controlled experiments in terms of applicability to the real world. This is because real-world ecological variables are multidimensional, nonlinear, and different aspects can interact in multiple ways.
